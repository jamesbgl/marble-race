# Timer System
,
## Overview
The timer system tracks player performance through the level, providing feedback and enabling competition through time-based scoring.
,
## Current Implementation
- Start on first movement
- Stop on level completion
- Display in seconds with 2 decimal places
- Reset on restart
,
### Timer Components
1. Display
   - Large, centered text
   - Clear visibility
   - Real-time updates
   - Final time display
,
2. State Management
   - Ready state
   - Running state
   - Paused state
   - Ended state
,
3. Controls
   - Start trigger
   - Stop trigger
   - Reset functionality
   - Pause capability
,
## Technical Requirements
,
### Timing Accuracy
- Must be precise to 2 decimal places
- Must update at 60fps
- Must be consistent across devices
- Must handle frame drops gracefully
,
### State Management
- Must track all game states
- Must persist through level
- Must reset properly
- Must handle edge cases
,
### Performance Requirements
- Minimal impact on performance
- Efficient updates
- Memory efficient
- No frame drops
,
## Acceptance Criteria
1. Timer starts on first movement
2. Timer stops on completion
3. Display updates smoothly
4. Reset works correctly
5. Time is accurate
,
## Dependencies
- React
- Zustand
- requestAnimationFrame
- Performance API
,
## Known Issues
1. Occasional frame drop impact
2. Mobile device inconsistencies
3. Browser tab switching effects
4. Edge case state transitions
,
## Planned Improvements
1. Best time tracking
2. Leaderboard system
3. Time splits
4. Replay system
5. Mobile optimization
,
## Implementation Notes
- Timer logic in Interface component
- State management in Zustand store
- Update loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Performance optimization techniques
,
## Testing Requirements
1. Timing accuracy tests
2. State transition tests
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Mobile compatibility tests
5. Browser compatibility tests
