# Track System
,
## Overview
The track system manages the level structure, including track segments, obstacles, and boundaries. It provides a procedural generation system for creating varied and challenging levels.
,
## Current Implementation
- Modular track segments
- Procedural obstacle placement
- Dynamic boundary system
- Start and end zones
,
### Track Components
1. Start Block
   - Title display
   - Initial track surface
   - Starting position
,
2. Obstacle Blocks
   - Spinner obstacles
   - Limbo obstacles
   - Axe obstacles
   - Random placement
,
3. End Block
   - Finish line
   - Victory model
   - Completion trigger
,
## Technical Requirements
,
### Track Generation
- Must generate consistent tracks
- Must maintain playability
- Must provide varied challenges
- Must respect difficulty progression
,
### Obstacle Placement
- Must avoid overlapping
- Must maintain minimum spacing
- Must provide clear paths
- Must scale with difficulty
,
### Performance Requirements
- Efficient mesh generation
- Optimized collision setup
- Memory-efficient asset loading
- Smooth level transitions
,
## Acceptance Criteria
1. Track is always completable
2. Obstacles are properly spaced
3. Boundaries prevent falling
4. Performance remains stable
5. Generation is deterministic
,
## Dependencies
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- @react-three/rapier
- Zustand
,
## Known Issues
1. Occasional obstacle overlap
2. Edge cases in generation
3. Performance with many segments
4. Mobile device limitations
,
## Planned Improvements
1. More obstacle types
2. Custom track themes
3. Difficulty settings
4. Track sharing system
5. Procedural textures
,
## Implementation Notes
