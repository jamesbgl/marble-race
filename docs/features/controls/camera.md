# Camera System
,
## Overview
The camera system provides a dynamic third-person view that follows the marble while maintaining smooth movement and optimal visibility of the track ahead.
,
## Current Implementation
- Third-person perspective
- Smooth following
- Height and distance adjustment
- Momentum-based movement
,
### Camera Components
1. Position
   - Offset: [0, 0.65, 2.25]
   - Height adjustment
   - Distance maintenance
   - Smooth interpolation
,
2. Target
   - Marble position
   - Height offset: 0.25
   - Smooth following
   - Perspective maintenance
,
3. Movement
   - Lerp factor: 5
   - Momentum preservation
   - Smooth transitions
   - Collision avoidance
,
## Technical Requirements
,
### Camera Movement
- Must follow smoothly
- Must maintain visibility
- Must avoid obstacles
- Must handle jumps
,
### Performance
- Must update at 60fps
- Must be smooth
- Must not cause jitter
- Must be efficient
,
### Behavior
- Must maintain perspective
- Must handle all movements
- Must avoid clipping
- Must provide good visibility
,
## Acceptance Criteria
